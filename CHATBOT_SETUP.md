## Customization

```javascript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a helpful AI assistant for Smart Campus KLH...
// Customize this to match your campus needs
`;
```

### Add More Suggestions

Edit the `getSuggestions` function in `backend/controllers/chatbotController.js`:

```javascript
const suggestions = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Your custom suggestion',
    category: 'custom-category',
  },
  // Add more suggestions
];
```

### Customize UI

Edit `frontend/src/components/chatbot/Chatbot.jsx` to modify:
- Colors and themes
- Avatar styles
- Message bubble designs
- Animation effects

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Responding

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. **Check Console**: Look for errors in browser console and server logs
3. **Verify Backend**: Make sure backend is running on port 5000
4. **Test API**: Try hitting `/api/chatbot/suggestions` directly

### API Key Error

```
Error: GEMINI_API_KEY is not defined
```

**Solution**: Add the API key to `backend/.env`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### CORS Issues

If you get CORS errors:
1. Check `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env`
2. Ensure it matches your frontend URL (default: `http://localhost:5173`)

### Slow Responses

- Gemini API may take 2-5 seconds to respond
- This is normal for AI generation
- Loading indicator shows while waiting

## Best Practices

1. **Conversation Context**: The chatbot keeps last 10 messages for context
2. **Clear Messages**: Use the "X" button to clear conversation history
3. **Specific Questions**: Ask specific questions for better responses
4. **Use Suggestions**: Click suggested questions for common queries

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env` file with real API keys
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use environment variables in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chatbot endpoint is protected (requires authentication)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement rate limiting in production

## Cost Considerations

Google Gemini API has:
- Free tier with request limits
- Pay-as-you-go pricing beyond free tier
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

For production:
- Set up usage alerts
- Implement request caching
- Add rate limiting per user

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Voice input/output
- [ ] File attachment support
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Integration with campus database for real-time data
- [ ] Proactive notifications
- [ ] Chat history persistence

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check server logs: `backend/logs`
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Review API responses in Network tab
- Test API endpoints with Postman
