❌ Bypass authentication security
❌ View passwords (encrypted in database)

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### **1. Admin-Only Routes**

These backend routes require admin role:

```javascript
GET    /api/auth/users              // Get all users
PUT    /api/auth/users/:id/role     // Update user role
PUT    /api/auth/users/:id/deactivate // Deactivate user
PUT    /api/announcements/:id/pin   // Pin announcement
```

### **2. Role-Based Access Control**

Frontend automatically hides/shows features based on role:

```javascript
{user?.role === 'admin' && (
  <Button>Delete</Button>  // Only visible to admins
)}
```

### **3. Token-Based Authentication**

All admin actions require valid JWT token:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Role: admin (verified on server)
```

## 🎯 Admin Best Practices

### **1. User Management**

✅ **DO**:
- Verify identity before promoting to admin
- Use deactivate instead of delete for troublesome users
- Document role changes in admin logs
- Regularly review user list for inactive accounts

❌ **DON'T**:
- Give admin role to untested users
- Deactivate users without warning
- Change roles during active sessions

### **2. Content Moderation**

✅ **DO**:
- Review feedback regularly
- Respond to high-priority items first
- Delete spam/inappropriate content
- Update feedback status promptly

❌ **DON'T**:
- Delete valid feedback
- Ignore pending items
- Mark unresolved issues as resolved

### **3. Announcements**

✅ **DO**:
- Pin only critical announcements
- Set appropriate expiry dates
- Use clear, concise language
- Target specific audiences when relevant

❌ **DON'T**:
- Pin too many announcements (max 2-3)
- Create announcements without expiry
- Use vague or unclear titles
